# matrix_game

This was a lab assignment for school. While it seems to be a little incohesive and all over the place,
the purpose of the assignment was to demonstrate the ability to validate user entries (phone number
and ZIP code) as well as demonstrate a basic understanding for Numpy operations using matrices.
